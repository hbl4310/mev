# Probabilistic electoral methods, representative probability, and maximum entropy 

This repository tries to implement the "mev0" probabilistic voting scheme described in this {paper}[http://www.inference.org.uk/sewell/RFS-Electoral-Methods-TM-002-v1.9.pdf]. 
The {original matlab code}[http://www.inference.org.uk/sewell/] and is pythonised here. 
Modulo differences in random number seeding and generation, it is hopefully faithful.
